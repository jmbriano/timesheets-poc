# DATA_SOURCE can either be CSV or ONLINE. If ONLINE, it will extract the whole month from Freshbook directly.
DATA_SOURCE=CSV

MONTH=12
YEAR=2018

#Possible split modes:
# REALITY: Hours are loaded in the day they were actually worked
# EVENLY: The total hours for the row are split evenly in all working days
# PROVISIONAL: The total hours will be recorded in the first week day. See EXPAND definition below.
SPLIT_MODE=REALITY

# EXPAND is only used if SPLIT_MODE=PROVISIONAL.
If EXPAND=YES then the actual totals will be linearly extrapolated to the whole month. Otherwise no extrapolation will occur.
EXPAND=YES

# If you need to add a common description to all the timesheets, it can be added here. The tool will look for a combination of SC_RFA_CI_WP (values concatenated with '_'). It will use the most precise one.
# Examples:
# WP.8.1.1=A,B,C will add "A,B,C" to every row that contains WP.8.1.1
# PROJA_WP.8.1.1=D,E,F will add "D,E,F" to every row that contains WP.8.1.1 and PROJA as CI.

PROJ_1_WP.8.1.1= This is the description for row with PROJ_1 and WP.8.1.1
SC1_QTM3_PROJ_1_WP3=This is the description for row with SC1, QTM3, PROJ_1 and WP3
WP3=This is the description for rows with WP3

# HOURS_FORMAT=0 will show only the integer part (no decimals). HOURS_FORMAT=0.00 will show two decimals
HOURS_FORMAT=0.00
