#Possible split modes:
# reality: Hours are loaded in the day they were actually worked
# evenly: The total hours for the row are split evenly in all working days
# provisional: The total hours will be recorded in the first week day. See EXPAND definition below.
SPLIT_MODE=provisional

# EXPAND is only used if SPLIT_MODE=provisional.
If EXPAND=YES then the actual totals will be linearly extrapolated to the whole month. Otherwise no extrapolation will occur.
EXPAND=YES

# If you need to add a common description to all the timesheets, it can be added here. The tool will look for a combination of SC_RFA_CI_WP (values concatenated with '_'). It will use the most precise one.
# Examples:
# WP.8.1.1=A,B,C will add "A,B,C" to every row that contains WP.8.1.1
# PROJA_WP.8.1.1=D,E,F will add "D,E,F" to every row that contains WP.8.1.1 and PROJA as CI.

PROJ_1_WP.8.1.1= This is the description for row with PROJ_1 and WP.8.1.1
SC1_QTM3_PROJ_1_WP3=This is the description for row with SC1, QTM3, PROJ_1 and WP3
WP3=This is the description for rows with WP3
